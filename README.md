# BugTracker---Redux-App

This is a Bug tracker app done in REDUX. 

Step 1 : Design the store with initial state of bugs.

Step 2: Defined actions of the bug tracker such as Bug Added, Bug Removed, Bug Resolved etc.

Step 3: Created a reducer which accepts store and action type and it creates a copy and updates the copy and hence updates a new state. 

Step 4: Setup the Store with new values and also notify the UI components which are dependent on this store values.
